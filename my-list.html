                    <h1>BHARATNATYAM</h1>
                    <p>Bharatanatyam is a major hindu form of Indian classical dance that originated in the modern-day region of Tamil Nadu. The Natya Shastra by Bharata Muni and Abhinaya Darpana by Nandikeshvara are considered to be the original sources one of Bharatanatyam.
                        Bharatanatyam, a pre-eminent Indian classical dance form presumably the oldest classical dance heritage of India is regarded as mother of many other Indian classical dance forms. Conventionally a solo dance performed only by women, it initiated in the Hindu temples of Tamil Nadu and eventually flourished in South India. Theoretical base of this form traces back to ‘Natya Shastra’, the ancient Sanskrit Hindu text on the performing arts.
                        In these dance forms usually tradional fashion is followed.

                    <h1>HIP-HOP</h1>
                    <p>Hip-hop dance is a unique and exciting style of street dance that is most commonly performed to hip-hop music. Hip-hop dance is a vibrant form of dance that combines a variety of freestyle movements to create a cultural piece of art. Through its three main styles of popping, locking, and breaking, hip-hop dance has evolved into one of the most popular and influential styles of dance.

                        Greeley dance studio, A Dance Place, enjoys teaching hip-hop dance because of its more laid back style that allows dancers to let loose and worry less about technique and more about expressing themselves through their movement and their music. With more upbeat music, hip-hop dance creates a different level of fun and creativity.

                    <h1>PUNJABI</h1>
                    <p>bhangra, folk dance and music of the Punjab (northwestern India and northeastern Pakistan) and the popular music genre that emerged from it in the mid-to-late 20th century. Cultivated in two separate but interactive styles—one centred in South Asia, the other within the South Asian community of the United Kingdom—the newer bhangra blends various Western popular musics with the original Punjabi tradition. It enjoys an immense following in South Asia and within the South Asian diaspora.

                        The term bhangra originally designated a particular dance performed by Sikh and Muslim men in the farming districts of the Punjab region of South Asia. The dance was associated primarily with the spring harvest festival Baisakhi, and it is from one of the major products of the harvest—bhang (hemp)—that bhangra drew its name.

                    <h1>STREET DANCE</h1>
                    <p>When it comes to the clothing you wear to your first hip hop dance class, aim for casual. A loose fighting t-shirt and a pair of sweatpants are completely acceptable. Or, if you're inclined, you can go out and buy some trendy new hip hop pants and tops. But the rule of thumb, whatever you wear, is to make sure you're donning clothes that are comfortable and easy to move in.

                        A few other things to keep in mind when dressing for hip hop dance class:
                        
                        Most dancers typically wear baggier hip hop pants rather than shorts, spandex or yoga pants that you might see in other types of dance classes. But a regular pair of sweatpants will do, as well. <br>
                        Make sure everything is clean and washed. Hip hop class is casual, but that doesn't mean you should show up sloppy. <br>
                        Keep the jewelry light. This is still dance class, after all, and wearing too much of it -- especially if it's bigger and chunkier -- can actually put you and your fellow dancers at risk for an injury.</p>

                    <h1>BALLET</h1>
                    <p>ballet costume, clothing designed to allow dancers freedom of movement while at the same time enhancing the visual effect of dance movements—for example, the ballerina’s tutu, a multilayered skirt that creates an impression of lightness and flight.

                        In the earliest ballets of the 17th century, dancers traditionally wore heeled shoes. Men wore the costume à la Romaine, or tonnelet, a stiff, wired skirt of brocade or similar material, resembling in shape the modern tutu. Women wore heavy costumes reminiscent of court dress, with elaborate trains, and wigs and jewels. Male and sometimes female dancers wore leather masks, comic or tragic in appearance, that represented the character portrayed and concealed all facial expression.</p>

                    <h1>JAZZ</h1>
                    <p>
                        Jazz dance is a performance dance and style that arose in the United States in the mid 20th century.[1] Jazz dance may allude to vernacular jazz about to Broadway or dramatic jazz. The two types expand on African American vernacular styles of dance that arose with jazz music. Vernacular jazz dance incorporates ragtime moves, Charleston, Lindy hop and mambo. Popular vernacular jazz dance performers include The Whitman Sisters, Florence Mills, Ethel Waters, Al Minns and Leon James, Frankie Manning, Norma Miller, Dawn Hampton, and Katherine Dunham. Dramatic jazz dance performed on the show stage was promoted by Jack Cole, Bob Fosse, Eugene Louis Faccuito, and Gus Giordano.

                        The term 'jazz dance' has been used in ways that have little or nothing to do with jazz music. Since the 1940s, Hollywood movies and Broadway shows have used the term to describe the choreographies of Bob Fosse and Jerome Robbins. In the 1990s, colleges and universities applied to the term to classes offered by physical education departments in which students dance to various forms of pop music, rarely jazz.
